# leftovers
Not-quite-finished Flutter app which lets users give away and find food. I haven't worked on this in a few months, so quite a few of the APIs and libraries are deprecated. Works with location data and Firebase (Cloud Firestore & Storage) to let users post listings for free food, and to locate listings in their area.
